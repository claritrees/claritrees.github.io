My new venture.

@section{Motivation}

I'm in my head a lot. Sometimes I go in circles. It'd be good to type
out the thoughts to see changes, and patterns in my thought. It'd also
be good to share these things because there's a certain effort made to
elucidate what I could have previous hand-waved.

This is for you too. Look into my mind and see what you can take from
it. Show me yours.
